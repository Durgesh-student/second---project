PERSONAL RESUME WEBSITE *
Hi, I'm Durgesh, an aspiring Frontend Developer. This is my personal resume website built using HTML and CSS as part of my web development learning journey.

WHAT I LEARNED IN CSS : While building this project, I improved my understanding of several important CSS concepts.

CSS BOX MODEL : I learned about margin, padding, border, and the content area, and how they affect the spacing and layout of elements.

CSS SELECTORS : I practiced using element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and universal selectors to target and style different elements.

TEXT PROPERTIES : I worked with properties such as font-family, font-weight, text-align, text-decoration, line-height, and text-transform to control text appearance.

BACKGROUNG PROPERTIES : I used background-color, background-image, and background-position to enhance the visual design of the webpage.

LAYOUT AND POSITIONING SYSTEM : I learned about the display property, position (relative and absolute), float, and different CSS units like px, %, em, and rem.

FLEXBOX : I practiced using flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, and flex-flow to create flexible and responsive layouts.
